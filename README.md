## 1. Project description:
The Iris dataset contains data on four features: length and width of sepals and petals for 50 data samples belonging to three different species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. The aim of this report was to use hierarchical analysis to classify data samples into clusters based on two out of four features mentioned above.

## 2. The project contains the following analyses: 
* **Data pre-processing** 
* **Optimising distance matrix**
* **Optimising linkage type**
* **Calculating Silhouette score**
* **Final data separation into clusters based on the most optimal parameters**
